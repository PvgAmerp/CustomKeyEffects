Hi and welcome to Custom Key Effects! Before you do ANYTHING go to your terminal and type these commands: "pip install keyboard" and "pip install pygame". You can create an effect either by using the 'Interface.pyw' script or create one at the effects folder manually. Then, open 'start.py'. Also remember to remove the brackets when you paste a path. Hope you enjoy! don't forget to use this to troll hehe
